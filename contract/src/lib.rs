    ///
    /// 1. **Active game exists** – a `GameState` record is present in storage
    ///    for `player`.
    /// 2. **Revealed phase** – the game must be in `GamePhase::Revealed`,
    ///    meaning `reveal` has already been called and the outcome is known.
    /// 3. **Positive streak** – `game.streak >= 1`, confirming the player
    ///    actually won the last flip.  A `Revealed` game with `streak == 0`
    ///    represents a loss state and must not be continued.
    /// 4. **Non-zero commitment** – `new_commitment` must not be the all-zero
    ///    32-byte value.  An all-zero commitment is treated as a missing or
    ///    placeholder value and is rejected with `InvalidCommitment`.
    /// 5. **Sufficient reserves** – the contract must hold enough reserves to
    ///    cover the worst-case payout at the *next* streak level.
    ///
    /// ## Process (on success)
    ///
    /// 1. All precondition guards are evaluated (no state mutation on failure).
    /// 2. New contract randomness is derived from the current ledger sequence.
    /// 3. Game phase is reset to `Committed` with the fresh commitment and
    ///    randomness; the streak counter and wager are preserved.

    // Feature: Continue Availability

    // ## Access Invariants
    //
    // `continue_streak` is ONLY available when ALL of the following hold:
    //
    //   1. A game record exists for the player (`NoActiveGame` otherwise).
    //   2. The game is in `GamePhase::Revealed` (`InvalidPhase` otherwise).
    //   3. `game.streak >= 1` — the player won the last flip
    //      (`NoWinningsToClaimOrContinue` when streak == 0).
    //   4. `new_commitment` is not all-zero bytes (`InvalidCommitment` otherwise).
    //   5. Reserves cover the next-streak worst-case payout
    //      (`InsufficientReserves` otherwise).
    //
    // The properties below exhaustively verify invariants 1–3 across random
    // inputs, confirming that only a `Revealed` game with a positive streak
    // can enter the continue flow.  Invariants 4–5 are covered by the error
    // code descriptiveness block above.
    //
    // ## Why property tests?
    //
    // Unit tests check specific values; property tests confirm the invariant
    // holds for *any* wager, streak, or phase value in the valid domain.
    // This is especially important for phase gating: a single off-by-one in
    // a match arm could silently allow a `Committed` game to continue, which
    // would let a player skip the reveal step and manipulate outcomes.

//   P-2  Fee accumulation is additive and order-independent: the total is the

//   P-3  A fee_bps change between payouts is reflected immediately — earlier
//        payouts use the old rate, later payouts use the new rate.
//   P-4  At fee_bps = 200 (minimum) and fee_bps = 500 (maximum), the running
//        total stays within the mathematically expected bounds.

// Validates that winning reveals increment the streak counter exactly once per
// win, that progression through multiplier tiers is strictly monotonic, and
// that no tier is ever skipped regardless of the starting streak value.
//
// Invariants under test:
//   I-1  A single win increments streak by exactly 1 (never 0, never 2+).
//   I-2  Streak progression is strictly monotonic: streak_n+1 == streak_n + 1.
//   I-3  No multiplier tier is skipped: every tier 1→2→3→4 is reachable in
//        exactly one step from the previous tier.
//   I-4  Streak starts at 0 on a fresh game and reaches tier 1 on the first win.
//   I-5  Streak saturates at tier 4+ — the multiplier is capped but the counter
//        continues to increment (no overflow, no reset).
//   I-6  Payout at streak N+1 is strictly greater than payout at streak N for
//        any fixed wager and fee (multiplier monotonicity drives payout growth).

//  LF-1  On any loss, `reveal` returns `Ok(false)`.
//  LF-2  On any loss, the player's game state is completely deleted from
//        storage — no stale entry remains.
//  LF-3  On any loss, `reserve_balance` increases by exactly the forfeited
//        wager — no more, no less.
//  LF-4  After a loss the player slot is free: a new `start_game` call with
//        a valid wager succeeds immediately.
//  LF-5  A loss resets the streak to 0 for the next game (no streak carry-over).
//  LF-6  Both sides (Heads / Tails) trigger the same forfeiture semantics when
//        the outcome is the opposite side.
//  LF-7  Reserve overflow is handled safely: `checked_add` prevents wrapping
//        even when `reserve_balance` is near `i128::MAX`.
//
// OUTCOME DERIVATION (test environment):
//   contract_random = sha256(ledger_seq.to_be_bytes())

// Integration Test Harness
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// # Overview
//
// This module provides a reusable, deterministic harness for full end-to-end
// integration tests of the Tossd coinflip game flow.
//
// # Design Goals
//
// - **Deterministic fixtures**: all secrets, commitments, and reserve amounts
//   are derived from fixed seed bytes so test outcomes never vary between runs.
// - **Minimal boilerplate**: `Harness::new` wires up the Soroban test env,
//   registers the contract, and initialises it in one call.
// - **Composable helpers**: `play_win_round` / `play_loss_round` drive the
//   full commit→reveal cycle so individual tests stay focused on assertions.
// - **No token contract required**: [cash_out](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/hp/Documents/Tossd/contract/src/lib.rs:691:4-744:5) is used for settlement so tests
//   run without a deployed SAC token, keeping CI fast and hermetic.
//
// # Usage
//
// ```rust
// let h = Harness::new();
// let player = h.player();
// h.fund(1_000_000_000);
// h.start(&player, Side::Heads, 10_000_000, 1);   // seed 1 → Heads win
// let won = h.reveal(&player, 1);
// assert!(won);
// let payout = h.cash_out(&player);
// assert!(payout > 0);
// ```
//
// # Fixture Seed Convention
//
// `make_secret(env, seed)` returns `Bytes::from_slice(env, &[seed; 32])`.
// The outcome of a round depends on `sha256(secret ++ contract_random)[0] % 2`:
//
// | seed | outcome | use with Side::Heads |
// |------|---------|----------------------|
// |  1   | Heads   | WIN                  |
// |  3   | Tails   | LOSE                 |
//
// Calibrated from loss_forfeiture_tests: [3u8;32] → sha256[0]=0x64 (low bit 0)
// XOR contract_random[0]=0xdf → bit 1 → Tails → loss for a Heads player.
//
// Use `Harness::probe_outcome` to discover the winning seed for any ledger
// sequence when writing new tests.
//
// # Harness Fields
//
// - [env](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/hp/Documents/Tossd/contract/src/lib.rs:3569:4-3591:5)         – Soroban test environment (mock_all_auths enabled)
// - `contract_id` – registered CoinflipContract address
// - `client`      – generated client for calling contract methods
// - [config](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/hp/Documents/Tossd/contract/src/lib.rs:392:4-395:5)      – snapshot of the initialised ContractConfig
